# TypeScript Next.js with Styled-System

This is a template for using Next.js with TypeScript, styled-components, styled-system, Storybook, Jest, ESLint, and Prettier.

It includes a sample theme for styled-system as well as some primitive components that are useful for building layouts and design system components.

The `package.json` includes the following scripts. Before running these scripts, make sure to run `yarn` to install all of the required dependencies.

- `yarn dev` - Run the Next.js server in development mode
- `yarn build` - Make a production build of the Next.js server
- `yarn start` - Start the production Next.js server
- `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript's type-checker without emitting any code
- `yarn storybook` - Run Storybook locally in watch mode
- `yarn jest` - Run the Jest test suite in watch mode
- `yarn jest-coverage` - Run the Jest test suite and collect test coverage
- `yarn view-coverage` - Open the test coverage report in your browser
- `yarn lint` - Lint the project with ESLint
- `yarn prettier:check` - Check that all code files are formatted according to the Prettier configuration
- `yarn prettier:fix` - Format the entire project according to the Prettier configuration
- `yarn is-valid` - Assert that all acceptance criteria for committing code is met
