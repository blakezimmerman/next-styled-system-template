# Box

The `Box` component is the most basic of all UI primitives.
It is essentially a `div` that accepts props to modify properties relating to border, color, layout, position, shadow, and space.
However, by using the polymorphic `as` prop, this component can be rendered as any HTML element you like.

With great power comes responsibility, so I recommend that you use this component sparingly.
It should only be used to make other small reusable components or simple layouts that don't require flexbox or grid layout.

## Make Reusable Components

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <Story name="Reusable Component">
    <Box padding={4} borderRadius={1} shadow={2} bg="background3">
      I&apos;m a card component
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Make Simple Layouts

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <Story name="Simple Layout">
    <Box padding={4} bg="background2">
      I have a background and some padding
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
