# Buttons

Buttons are clickable elements used to perform an action.

## Base Button

This the most primitive button.
It simply renders a `button` element with all the default browser styles removed.
This component accepts all of props that are accepted by both the `Flex` component and the native `button` element.

In general, this component should be reserved for implementing other components in the design system, however, it does make sense to occasionally use it for one-off situations where you need to make an element clickable.

<Canvas withSource={SourceState.OPEN}>
  <Story name="BaseButton">
    <BaseButton onClick={action("Clicked")}>Click Me</BaseButton>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
